# Manawave Demo

An artistic, flairy homepage to describe, explain, and show what manawave is and what it can do.

It is organized into 2 parts: homepage and realm. The homepage should lead users to the realms, docs, or github.

> A _realm_ is an artistic demonstration or idea of what manawave can do. It should be inspired from personal experiences that helped evolve their sense of self (infinite evolution). It should also reveal an aspect or creative usage of manawave's omnidirectional or customizable capabilities.

## Getting Started

From the root of the repo (`cd ../` this directory)

```shell
pnpm nx dev manawave-demo
```

This will build and load `manawave` onto this project as a dependency.

## General Notes

A lot of effects for the demos make use of CSS `mix-blending-mode: overlay` and `webm` video or `webp` animation.
