## Items

A marquee has a _grid_ of _items_ repeating across it. An item is an instance of repeatable content.

<Sandpack />

## Pipeline

Before starting, you need to know that MANAWAVE has two pipelines split into multiple phases to get all marquee functionality working.
The phases written here are **ordered from start to finish**.

### Marquee Pipeline

This pipeline controls how _all_ items

#### 1. Layout

#### 2. Movement

#### 3. Loop

### DOM Pipeline

You can basically treat this pipeline as a "lifecycle" structure. Each item in the marquee is represented in the DOM
that gets destroyed and created over time.
