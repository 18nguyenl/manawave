Overrides give you the ability to "override" a default value or control of MANAWAVE.
You usually do this by invoking or configuring [pipeline hooks](/docs/reference/instance/#mw-methods).

These methods follow a uniform format: you get a set of inputs and you output the override.
The inputs are generally good-to-haves, but you really don't need them at all. They're just utility.

The override is in the output. For some hooks, you could return a value, and this value will be used
_instead_ of what is default. **This does not mean internal state _understand_ this**. Again,
you're just intercepting and overriding what would've been used.
