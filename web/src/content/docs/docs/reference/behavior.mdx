This will give you a more detailed look at how MANAWAVE works. It's mostly for you to more
predictably use MANAWAVE.

## Items

Each piece of repeatable content in MANAWAVE is called an **item**.
The most important aspect of an **item** is its _measurement_.

<Sandpack />

### Measurements

A _measurement_ is the _width_ and _height_ of an **item**. Measurements are calculated on layout.

The way an item is measured is by boxing the DOM content into an `inline-block` wrapper.
This creates a new [block formatting context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context), which
allows us to capture the total [margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) + content of the content.

This means measurements respect the [new line behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block/CSS) of block elements.
It **does not respect** block elements stretching their width.

### Grid

Items are laid out across a grid sized according to the marquee container width and height. This means
there are a limited set of items that depend on the size of the marquee.

## Pipeline

MANAWAVE has two pipelines split into multiple phases to get all marquee functionality working.
The phases written here are **ordered from start to finish**.

### Marquee Pipeline

This pipeline controls how _all_ items get positioned. Before anything goes through the pipeline, they're all measured.

#### 1. Layout

First, fit and repeat all the items across a grid spanning the width and height of the marquee. The only thing that's accounted here are the
_current_ measurements.

#### 2. Movement

Second, move all the items. You can think of things as "everything is already set in place so we can move it now". By default,
it moves `1px` to the right (0 degrees).The `speed` and `direction` attribute multiply the motion vector at this point.

#### 3. Loop

Third, if the item is outside the marquee bounding box, move the item to the "other" or opposite side. You can think of this as
wrapping an item from one end to the other. For example, an item moved far left off the screen so it appears again on the right side.

### DOM Pipeline

You can basically treat this pipeline as a "lifecycle" structure. Each item in the marquee is represented in the DOM
that gets destroyed and created over time. This pipeline gets evaluated cooperatively with the **marquee pipeline**.

#### 1. Element Created

After all the items move (which means they're properly laid out), they're ready to be rendered. Rendering starts with
creating a DOM element clone of the original content. The number of elements cloned depend on what's required for the grid.

**As of this step, the item is not on the DOM**. This is very important for any pre-rendering / DOM tasks off page / document.

This only happens **once per layout**. You can think of this as an initialization step.

#### 2. Element Drawn

The element is repeatedly updated and drawn onto the DOM. Usually, this is seen as items moving across the marquee.
This is when an item is "rendered".

#### 3. Element Destroyed

The element and item is destroyed during this step. It only happens during a [relayout](#relayout).
The old element and item are destroyed and replaced by a new one.

### Relayout

In short, all the pipeline steps get done again.

You may see the term "relayout" in the docs. This basically means the entire marquee gets reset.
Every single item and its position gets recalculated, re-evaluated, and redrawn as completely new versions of itself.
Anything old gets discarded, including old items, data, and elements.

Any unique ID gets refreshed and any DOM element is replaced with a new one. This is important if you have any
[override](/docs/reference/overrides) that leave _references_ to this code (from a [memory management](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_management) perspective).

### Render

When you see the term "render", it refers to the [DOM pipeline](#dom-pipeline).
