description: A list of limitations for MANAWAVE
---

While MANAWAVE can be customized thoroughly, there are a couple things that may be deal-breakers.

## No frameworks

MANAWAVE is NOT associated with any web framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) nor is there an API for it.
This is because MANAWAVE is part challenge to create something that should work out-of-box for **any** HTML & CSS website.

## No de-initialization nor destruction

MANAWAVE is not destructable. It stays in memory the moment it's initialized.

## Does not keep track its position

When a resize or relayout occurs, MANAWAVE does not keep track of its current "position" or where items should be synced to.
It instead, layouts everything again, fresh.

## Not fully behaving like native HTML & CSS

Margin collapsing between [items](/docs/reference/behavior) do not happen.
[Blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block/CSS) do not span the width of its parent container.
