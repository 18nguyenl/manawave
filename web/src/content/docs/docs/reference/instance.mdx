There are two ways you receive a MANAWAVE _instance_ to work with. A MANAWAVE instance is an
object that lets you [configure](/docs/reference/attributes), [override](/docs/guides/overrides), or control the marquee.
Also, an instance refers to the code that's managing and updating the marquee both in logic and on the DOM.

## MW

MW constructs and [initializes](/docs/guides/initialization) a marquee given a DOM element.
This will return you an instance.

```javascript
// queried from the page
const element = document.querySelector("#element");
const mw = new MW(element);
```

## <a id="options"></a> MW Options

```javascript
// selector with options
const MWOptions = {
  direction: "up",
  speed: 2.1,
  autoplay: true,
};

const mw = new MW("#element", MWOptions);
```

Here are all the options you can use:

### <a id="options-attributes"></a> Attributes

Attributes have [specific values and formats](/docs/reference/attributes) to be followed.

```json
{
  "speed": 2.1,
  "direction": 190.5,
  "autoplay": true
}
```

<LinkCard
  title="Attribute Values and Formats"
  href="/docs/reference/attributes"
/>

#### `speed`

**type**: `number` \
**default**: `1`

```json
{
  "speed": 2.1
}
```

#### `direction`

**type**: `number` \
**default**: `0`

```json
{
  "direction": 195.5
}
```

#### `autoplay`

**type**: `boolean` \
**default**: `false`

```json
{
  "autoplay": true
}
```

### Marquee Pipeline

These are the properties:

- `onLayout`
- `onMove`
- `onLoop`

You should refer to the [methods](#methods) section below for details. Instead of being assigned to a constant,
you would use the callback in the options object.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```javascript
const mw = new MW("...", {
  onLayout: ({ initialSize, position, limits}) => { ... }
})
```

</details>

<LinkCard title="Marquee Pipeline Methods" href="#methods-marquee" />

### DOM Pipeline

These are the properties:

- `onElementCreated`
- `onElementDrawn`
- `onElementDestroyed`

You should refer to the [methods](#methods) section below for details. Instead of being assigned to a constant,
you would use the callback in the options object.

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```javascript
const mw = new MW("...", {
  onElementCreated: ({ element, id }) => { ... }
})
```

</details>

<LinkCard title="DOM Pipeline Methods" href="#methods-dom" />

## MW Methods

These may look similar to the options because they are.
These methods are intended to dynamically update the marquee during runtime.

:::caution[Don't initialize the marquee with these methods]
While it may be tempting to [initialize](/docs/guides/initialization) by only using
these methods, it could cause [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content) because of [relayout](/docs/reference/behavior/#relayout).
If you're planning to initialize the state of a marquee, you should use the [options object](#options).

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```html
<div id="manawave-marquee">Content</div>
```

**DON'T**

```js
const mw = new MW("#manawave-marquee");
mw.autoplay = true;
mw.speed = 2;
mw.direction = 12;
mw.onLayout = ({ position, limits }) => { ... };
```

**DO**

```js
const mw = new MW("#manawave-marquee", {
  autoplay: true,
  speed: 2,
  direction: 12,
  onLayout: ({ position, limits}) => { ... }
});
```

</details>

:::

### <a id="methods"></a> General Methods

#### `eachElement`

**type**: `(data: { element: HTMLElement; id: string }) => void;`

Iterate through each element in the marquee and gives you the rendered `element` for manipulation.
You also get its current unique `id`.

```javascript
mw.eachElement(({ element, id }) => {
  element.style.background = "red";
});
```

See also: [behavior of rendering marquee logic](/docs/reference/behavior/#dom-pipeline)

### Attributes

These are designated differently from the attributes found in the options. You use these methods
to read and write changes to the attribute (except autoplay) over time (during runtime).

You might notice a "read" and "write" clause in the description. This means you can
get the current value (read) or set it to some other value during runtime (write).

See also: [MW Options Attributes](#options-attributes)

<LinkCard
  title="Attribute Values and Formats"
  href="/docs/reference/attributes"
/>

#### `speed`

You can use this to **read** and **write** the value.

```javascript
mw.speed = 1.5;
console.log(mw.speed); // 1.5
```

#### `direction`

You can use this to **read** and **write** the value.

```javascript
mw.direction = 20;
console.log(mw.direction); // 20
```

#### `autoplay`

You can use this to **write** the value.

```javascript
mw.autoplay = true;
```

### <a id="methods-marquee"></a> Marquee Pipeline

These are just like the [MW Options](#options) except they are invoked during runtime.
These methods allow you to dynamically update the marquee during runtime. If you want to read more in-depth, there's [a
reference about overrides](/docs/reference/overrides).

#### `onLayout`

**type**: `(data: {
    initialSize: Rect;
    position: vec2;
    limits: Rect;
}) => Partial<{ size: Rect; position: vec2 }> | void;`

Invoked when a layout or [relayout](/docs/reference/behavior/#relayout) occurs. This can override the final logical `size` and rendered `position` of
each [item](/docs/reference/behavior/#items). For logical size, the DOM element still renders its original content and size.
The final `size` refers to artificially adding or removing space for items. You can either add more spacing or squish items, in other words.

You're given the `initialSize` and `position` to reuse original values if you wish. You're also given the `limits` or bounding box of the marquee
for your utility. None of these are needed to use `onLayout`, but they're given if you want em'.

Triggers [relayout](/docs/reference/behavior#relayout) \
See also: [behavior of layout](/docs/reference/behavior/#1-layout)

```javascript
mw.onLayout = ({ position, limits, initialSize }) => {
  return {
    size: { width: initialSize.width + 10, height: initialSize.height + 10 },
    position: { x: position.x + 1, y: position.y + 1 },
  };
};
```

#### `onMove`

**type**: `(data: {
    direction: number;
    speed: number;
    dt: DOMHighResTimeStamp;
    t: DOMHighResTimeStamp;
}) => Partial<{
    direction: number;
}> | void;`

`onMove` is invoked when all the items in the marquee moves. Right now, the only [override](/docs/reference/overrides) is `direction`, which allows you to
programmatically or dynamically manipulate the resulting direction of all items. You're given some contextual data like the original `direction` or `speed` values.

You also get the delta time (time difference), `dt`, between marquee animation frames and total time, `t`. This is useful for syncing external animations to
the marquee's animation system.

```javascript
mw.onMove = ({ direction, speed, dt, t }) => {
  return { direction: 999 };
};
```

#### `onLoop`

**type**: `(data: {
    limits: BoundingBox;
    itemSize: Rect;
    marqueeSize: Rect;
    direction: vec2;
}) => Partial<{ limits: BoundingBox }> | void;`

`onLoop` is invoked when an [item](/docs/reference/behavior/#items) moves (wraps around) from one end or side of the marquee to the opposite.
You get the `limits`, the bounding box of the marquee. You also get some original values like the original `itemSize`, `marqueeSize`, and `direction`.
The `marqueeSize` refers to the pixel width and height of the MANAWAVE marquee DOM element.

Right now, you get to override the default `limits` to change _where_ an item should "loop" or wrap around the marquee.

```javascript
mw.onLoop = ({ limits, itemSize, marqueeSize, direction }) => {
  return {
    limits: {
      up: limits.up + 1,
      right: limits.right + 1,
      left: limits.left - 1,
      down: limits.down - 1,
    },
  };
};
```

### <a id="methods-dom"></a> DOM Pipeline

These are just like the [MW Options](#options) except they are invoked during runtime.
These methods allow you to interact with each marquee DOM element during runtime. If you want to read more in-depth, there's [a
reference about overrides](/docs/reference/overrides).

#### `onElementCreated`

**type**: `(data: {
    element: HTMLElement;
    id: string;
}) => Partial<{ element: HTMLElement }> | void`

`onElementCreated` is invoked when a marquee [item](/docs/reference/behavior/#items) is rendered onto the marquee. You receive
an `element` which is the original rendered HTML element. You can modify it just like any other HTML element. You also get the item's unique `id`
to reference this specific item.

You can _maybe_ replace the rendered HTML element with your own by returning it, but this hasn't been tested.
This might be removed in the future.

Triggers [relayout](/docs/reference/behavior/#relayout).

```javascript
mw.onElementCreated = ({ element, id }) => {
  element.style.background = "red";
};
```

#### `onElementDrawn`

**type**: `(data: {
    element: HTMLElement;
    id: string;
    dt: DOMHighResTimeStamp;
    t: DOMHighResTimeStamp;
}) => void`

`onElementDrawn` is invoked when a rendered marquee [item](/docs/reference/behavior/#items) is re-rendered or updated. You receive an `element`
representing the element that just updated. You can modify it just like any other HTML element. You also get the item's unique `id`
to reference this specific item.

You also get the animation delta time (difference in time) `dt` between frames and `t` the total animation time. This is useful for syncing
external animations to MANAWAVE's animation timeline.

Triggers [relayout](/docs/reference/behavior/#relayout).

```javascript
mw.onElementCreated = ({ element, id, dt, t }) => {
  element.textContent = t;
};
```

#### `onElementDestroyed`

**type**: `(data: {
    element: HTMLElement;
    id: string;
}) => void`

`onElementDestroyed` is invoked when a [relayout](/docs/reference/behavior/#relayout) occurs. A relayout would basically cause the marquee to reset,
flushing all items and IDs. You receive the `element` that will be deleted with its unique `id`. This may be useful for any cleanup operations you should perform before
the marquee gets reset.

```javascript
mw.onElementCreated = ({ element, id }) => {
  element.style.background = "initial";
};
```

## getMW

Given an `Element`, get an `MW` instance. You can use all the `MW` methods described above.

```javascript
const element = document.querySelector("#element");

const mw = getMW(element);
mw.play();
mw.direction = 30;
```
