import Sandpack from "@components/sandpack";

MANAWAVE can take advantage of user inputs by applying browser events. This builds on [overriding default behaviors](/docs/guides/overrides),
so if you want to find out more, read there. A more artistic example can be found visiting the [HYPERPINK Realm](/realms/hyperpink).

## Controlling direction with keyboard

For this example, you're going to use your keys to control the direction of the marquee.
It should feel like eight-direction movement in old-school JRPGs.

### Step 1: Setup

Generally, if you're going to start working with more customized behavior, you should
initialize a [DOM element marquee](/docs/guides/initialization/#dom). It should have some
[attributes](/docs/reference/attributes) to define the initial state.

### Step 2: Listen

Now, you need to gather data for the `MW` instance. `MW` is just a controller for the MANAWAVE marquee.
It just needs data to act upon. For our example, we'll go with keyboard data.

### Step 3: Apply

Now you can perform changes to `MW` given data. This will let you create a marquee that reacts with
what users do interactively.

`atan2` is a two-parameter [arctangent function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2). It's used in this example to accurately
get the angle or direction of a coordinate.
