:::caution
Overriding is intended for folks more familiar with angles, javascript, and MANAWAVE
:::

If you would like to create highly customized motion in MANAWAVE, you can override the defaults.
Overrides are here to give you control to pretty much all of MANAWAVE (or as much as what's sensible).
A good example of this is the realm, [Senbonzakura](/realms/senbonzakura).

This guide is more of a general introduction or starter to using overrides. If you want deeper understanding, you should read the [overrides reference page](/docs/reference/overrides).

## Overriding Overall Marquee

### onLayout

Invoked each time the marquee has to lay its entire grid of repeated content out again.
This usually happens when the marquee is initialized, and when the viewport is substantially resized.

<Sandpack html={SandpackSource.html} js={SandpackSource.js.layout} />

### onMove

Invoked each time all the marquee content move.

<Sandpack html={SandpackSource.html} js={SandpackSource.js.move} />

### onLoop

Invoked each time marquee content moves from one end of the marquee to the other.

<Sandpack html={SandpackSource.html} js={SandpackSource.js.loop} />

## Overriding Content Lifecycle

These methods give you direct access to each rendered DOM element of all marquee content.

:::danger[Never assume marquee elements last long]
These elements get _created and destroyed frequently_, so if you plan on keeping any references to it,
be very careful of memory leakage. These lifecycle hooks are here for you to _safely_ setup or destroy any
customized behavior.
:::

### onElementCreated

Invoked when an element is created. This happens when a layout occurs (marquee initialized or website resized).

<Sandpack html={SandpackSource.html} js={SandpackSource.js.elementCreated} />

### onElementDraw

Invoked when an element is rendered or updated. This happens when the element moves.

<Sandpack html={SandpackSource.html} js={SandpackSource.js.elementDrawn} />

### onElementDestroyed

Invoked when an element is destroyed. This happens when a layout occurs (marquee initialized or website resized).
You'll notice this is exactly what happens in `onElementCreated`. Basically, when a layout occurs,
all the old elements are destroyed and replaced by completely new ones.

<Sandpack html={SandpackSource.html} js={SandpackSource.js.elementDeleted} />

:::tip[These methods could be overriden during runtime]
This means you can swap out what happens (the implementation) for these methods dynamically.
