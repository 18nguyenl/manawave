MANAWAVE lets you take an existing marquee and control it in JavaScript.
If you need to get an existing MANAWAVE marquee, you should use `getMW()`.
`getMW` takes an existing [initialized marquee](/docs/guides/initialization) and gives you the attached `MW` instance.

For this example, notice how there's no `autoplay` nor `direction` [attribute](/docs/reference/attributes), but we set it anyways.
That's because we fetched the `MW` instance and applied these attributes there.

<Sandpack html={reusingHTML} js={reusingJS} />

:::caution[You might get FOUC if you use overrides]
If you use [overrides](/docs/reference/overrides), you might get [FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content).
That's because first, the document (web page content) has to load, then the marquees you initialized.
After the marquee initializes (repeats content across space), you can finally use `getMW()`. This multi-load step gives a lot of opportunity for
content to flash in and out as they're getting laid out across the page. Overrides makes this very visible.
