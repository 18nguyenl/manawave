MANAWAVE lets you take an existing marquee and control it in JavaScript.
If you need to get an existing MANAWAVE marquee, you should use `getMW()`.
`getMW` takes an existing [initialized marquee](/docs/guides/initialization) and gives you the attached `MW` instance.

:::tip[This is a good way extend a MANAWAVE web component]
`getMW` is designed for folks who want to extend the provided web component, `<manawave-marquee>`.
If you plan on doing any [override](/docs/guides/overrides), you should [avoid using the web component](/docs/guides/initialization/#dom)
and do everything in javascript. It has to do with [FOUC issues](#fouc).
:::

For this example, notice how there's no `autoplay` nor `direction` [attribute](/docs/reference/attributes), but we set it anyways.
That's because we fetched the `MW` instance and applied these attributes there.

<Sandpack html={reusingHTML} js={reusingJS} />

:::caution[You might get FOUC if you use overrides]

<a id="fouc"></a>

If you use [overrides](/docs/reference/overrides), you might get
[FOUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content). That's because
first, the document (web page content) has to load, then the marquees you
initialized. After the marquee initializes (repeats content across space), you
can finally use `getMW()`. This multi-load step gives a lot of opportunity for
content to flash in and out as they're getting laid out across the page.
Overrides makes this very visible.
