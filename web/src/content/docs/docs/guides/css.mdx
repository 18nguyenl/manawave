Styling MANAWAVE should be the same experience styling HTML regularly.

## Styling the marquee

You can style the marquee in any way you're familiar with it. Just make sure you
apply any relevant attributes (`class`, `id`, or `style`) to the marquee element itself.
If you use web components, you can style the marquee by using `manawave-marquee` as the selector.

Here are some basic examples of things you could do to style the marquee container.

<Sandpack activeFile="style.css" html={marqueeHTML} css={marqueeCSS} />

:::danger[flex, grid, and inline display types don't work on marquees]
By design, MANAWAVE doesn't interfere with your page's layout. It takes whatever is inside a designated space
and repeats it across a space.

If you want this functionality, you should make the [layout a child element of the marquee](#styling-content).

## <a id="styling-content"></a>Styling the content

Like styling the marquee container, you don't have to adjust how you regularly apply CSS to elements on a page.
Also, content that would be responsive without the marquee
_is still responsive_. You can think of anything that appears inside a marquee, even if content wraps, to repeat across that space.

It's easier to show by example, so here is one. All of what CSS would normally do still applies.

<Sandpack activeFile="style.css" html={contentHTML} css={contentCSS} />

:::tip[Do you use Flexbox or CSS Grid?]
If you plan on styling grids or flexboxes, you should make a wrapper element.

### Caveats

One thing you'll have to consider is that [margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_box_model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) between repeated content **doesn't happen**.
[This is by design](/docs/reference/behavior) to give you more control while balancing with [technical limitations](/docs/reference/limits).

Also, MANAWAVE measures content by its explicit dimensions ([box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)) including `padding` and `margin`.
Because of this, `display: block` won't have the rest of its width if there's extra. Content will, however, still break onto the next line.
To see how MANAWAVE does this more specifically, you should read on MANAWAVE's [behavior](/docs/reference/behavior).
