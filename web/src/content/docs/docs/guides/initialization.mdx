import Sandpack from "@components/sandpack";
import domHTML from "./_src/initialization/dom/index.html?raw";
import domJS from "./_src/initialization/dom/index.js?raw";

There are two main ways to initialize and use MANAWAVE: using the `<manawave-marquee>` web component or `MW` [object](#dom).

Generally for both approaches, MANAWAVE will take whatever is in the element (the children) and repeat them across its allocated space.

## Web Component

You can use the `<manawave-marquee>` web component to initialize MANAWAVE without writing any explicit JavaScript.

```html
<manawave-marquee> Content </manawave-marquee>
```

<Sandpack activeFile="index.html" />

## Classic DOM Element

<a id="dom"></a>

You can also initialize MANAWAVE using an existing element. You can pass in an element or CSS selector query to initialize.

<Sandpack html={domHTML} js={domJS} />
