description: Principles that define the advantages of using MANAWAVE
---

Generally, all design principles really boil down to MANAWAVE marquee behaving like a
native HTML element.

## Familiar

MANAWAVE is familiar for anyone who codes in HTML or CSS, even beginners. Remember the [marquee](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) element?
It's very easy to get a basic marquee working.

```html
<marquee>content</marquee>
```

<marquee scrollamount="2">content</marquee>

A marquee would work on anything that would be looped across the screen.

<marquee direction="up" scrollamount="2">
  <pre>This will loop even though it's not just text</pre>
</marquee>

The reason why a traditional `<marquee>` is used as example is because
using MANAWAVE should be as easy as using a `<marquee>`. You only
need to put content in the tag and it should work. If you want to
configure its behavior, you can pass in [attributes](/docs/reference/attributes).

:::caution[MANAWAVE is not a \<marquee\>]
You'll notice that MANAWAVE does not share attributes and behavior with `<marquee>` 1-to-1.
This is intentional to align MANAWAVE towards simpler and more common usages of marquees.
Reading about [MANAWAVE's behavior](/docs/reference/behavior) will point out to you these differences.
:::

## Standard

To put it shortly, using HTML & CSS in MANAWAVE just works. You don't have to account for
weirdness on MANAWAVE's end [most of the time](/docs/reference/limits).

Using MANAWAVE should feel like authoring HTML & CSS content regularly.
Special cases or exceptions are minimal. There's nothing special about
using MANAWAVE. It's just a marquee. It does everything you expect should happen.

This means any existing style or content you have can be used in MANAWAVE without too much hassle.
If the content is responsive, MANAWAVE accomodates for that too.

## <a id="customizable"></a> Customizable

As a start, MANAWAVE can be decently customized through its attributes.
This makes it low-friction for simple use cases, and even more smooth for web dev beginners.
MANAWAVE doesn't need that much JavaScript configuration to do stuff any marquee should do.

For more advanced developers, MANAWAVE considers wacky use cases beyond what's expected for a traditional marquee. You can see a bunch of these in the [Realms](/#realms).

Because a marquee shouldn't just move things across a screen and could be interactive,
customizability is something baked in. You can [override default behaviors](/docs/guides/overrides)
to make MANAWAVE fit more to what you think a marquee should do.

:::tip[From Ryuuart]
Personally, I even think it's not customizable enough. When I set out to make MANAWAVE,
I envisioned a marquee being more than a marquee. It should move in circles, dance across space,
express any infinite motion across a space. I kinda realized that it's not a marquee anymore â€”
that's like some wacky DOM particle system. This is something I wish for MANAWAVE in some future.

I envision really wild use cases for "marquees", like masonry grids that pull in data
and load different, dynamic formats over time. Or if you want to completely shift layouts.
Or if you want elements flying across a given space, even in 3D (with z-coordinate) in random motion paths.

MANAWAVE can't do what I mentioned perfectly, but it should give you a taste of it.

## Performant

MANAWAVE should be like using a `<marquee>`. A `<marquee>` loads everything near
instantaneously and you don't even have to think about loading states. It doesn't
intrude on your website. It shouldn't overwhelm nor break your website (for [regular cases](/docs/reference/limits)). When the viewport resizes,
it doesn't nuke the website. A MANAWAVE marquee should feel invisible and a natural part of a website.

## Isolated

Using MANAWAVE should not leak any effects onto other HTML elements or CSS styles.
Anything relating to a given MANAWAVE marquee only affects its children. This makes
MANAWAVE a [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) on vanilla HTML & CSS websites.
Your existing content does not need to adapt for MANAWAVE. You can wrap it on existing content and it'll work out fine.

If you choose to [not use MANAWAVE](/docs/reference/limits), removing it will not break your website.
Removing MANAWAVE will [gracefully degrade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation) and you'll just have your marquee children.
