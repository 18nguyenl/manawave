## Basic Usage

You can get a basic marquee with just web components.

<Sandpack activeFile="index.html" html={webcomponentHTML} />

If you plan on having a lot more customization, then you should make a new `MW` object.

<Sandpack html={javascriptHTML} js={javascriptJS} />

## Basic Customization

You can configure these marquess by supplying different [attributes](/docs/reference/attributes/).
There are three: `autoplay`, `speed`, and `direction`.

:::note
The attribute names are different to comply with web standards
