## Installing MANAWAVE

You can install MANAWAVE by a CDN `<script>` tag or with any `npm` utility.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
# you can use `yarn` or `pnpm` too if you want
npm install manawave
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="cdn">

**Classic Script (IIFE)**

```html
<!-- Add this to your HTML head  -->
<script
  defer
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/manawave@0.11.1/dist/manawave.min.js"
></script>
```

**Module Script (ESM)**

```html
<!-- Add this to your HTML head -->
<script
  type="module"
  src="https://unpkg.com/manawave@0.11.1/dist/manawave.js"
></script>
```

:::note
If you would like to use a different version, change the
version after the `@`. You can see the available versions on
[Github Releases](https://github.com/ryuuart/manawave/releases).

## Basic Usage

You can get a basic marquee with just MANAWAVE's web component: `<manawave-marquee>`.
There are more ways to [initialize MANAWAVE](/docs/guides/initialization).

```html
<manawave-marquee>
  <div class="text-manawave">web</div>
</manawave-marquee>
```

<Sandpack activeFile="index.html" html={webcomponentHTML} />

## Basic Customization

You can configure these marquees by supplying different [attributes](/docs/reference/attributes/).
For web components, there are three: `autoplay`, `speed`, and `direction`. There are a [limited set of allowed values](/docs/reference/attributes/) for these attributes, but
they enable the basic configurable and omnidirectional elements of MANAWAVE.

:::caution
[There are caveats](/docs/reference/attributes) for attributes if you don't use the `<manawave-marquee>` web component.
:::

<Sandpack activeFile="index.html" />

:::note
MANAWAVE has a [design principle of using minimal JavaScript](/docs/quickstart/principles#customizable) if customization is basic. You only import the library or include the script tag and that's it. That's why the web component (`<manawave-marquee>`) was included.

## Next Steps

While MANAWAVE's basic features should be sufficient for most _basic_ use cases, you can configure it more deeply.
To see what's possible, you should look into the [Realms](/#realms).

A good place to start understanding MANAWAVE is by looking through the guides.
You can start by learning how to more deeply [initialize marquees](/docs/guides/initialization) or configure [an existing marquee](/docs/guides/reusing).

It may also be a good idea to see what MANAWAVE [won't be able to do](/docs/reference/limits) for you.
