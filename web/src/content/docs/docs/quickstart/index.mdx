import Sandpack from "@components/sandpack";
 
[MANAWAVE](/) is a zero-dependency, customizable, and omnidirectional [marquee](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) for vanilla JS.

Ideally, for a basic marquee, you would only need to use the
included web component. Customizing behavior is done through JavaScript.

Here's a marquee for you to start playing with:

<Sandpack activeFile="index.html" />

## Examples

You can find a bunch of examples covering different possibilities by visiting the [Realms](/#realms).

## Troubleshooting

Most functionality should be documented here, but if you have any questions,
feel free to [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/ryuuart/manawave/issues/new).
